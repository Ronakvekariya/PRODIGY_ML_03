# Cat Vs Dog Classification : 
- This project implements an image classification system using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.
- The goal is to classify images into predefined categories based on their visual features.
- SVM is a powerful supervised learning model that can perform linear and non-linear classification effectively.

# Data Preparation
- The image data needs to be prepare as per the need of the model.
- For the svm , The image data is store as array.
- And the data is resized (reduce) to efficiently load and use the image by CPU and GPU

# Model train :
- Hyper Parameter
   1. kernel='rbf'
   2. C=1.0
